# EEE3088F-Project RMTDIC001 & NGMPHI006

## Description
This project is for the development and design of a Micro-Muse for EEE3088F 2024. The Micro Mouse contains a sesning Module, Power Module, as well as the main control unit(Mother-Board). The sensing system will sense obstacles in the proximity of the mouse, while the power module is mainly for powering the motors of the mouse and charging the on-board battery of the mouse. 

## Structure
* PCB: The KiCAD Project, Schematics & Layout and Project Libraries
* Firmware: Any software developed for the hardware or instructions on where to find relevant sofware
* Documents:â€ŠProject documentation and component datasheets
* Production: The gerber files, BOM, Budget, or anything required by the fabrication houses
* Simulation: Any simulation files (eg SPICE) or design stage generated results (Eg matlab or excel) 

## Installation
Software developed for the hardware or instructions on where to find relevant sofware-- To be updated 

## Usage
The project documentation can be found in the [Documents](https://github.com/Dichochi/EEE3088F-Project/tree/main/Documents) directory and the files required to produce the PCB can be found in the [Production](https://github.com/Dichochi/EEE3088F-Project/tree/main/Production) directory.
